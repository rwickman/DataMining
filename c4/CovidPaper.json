METHODS We developed a modified stacked\nauto-encoder for modeling the transmission dynamics of the epidemics. We\napplied this model to real-time forecasting the confirmed cases of Covid-19\nacross China. The data were collected from January 11 to February 27, 2020 by\nWHO. We used the latent variables in the auto-encoder and clustering algorithms\nto group the provinces/cities for investigating the transmission structure.\nRESULTS We forecasted curves of cumulative confirmed cases of Covid-19 across\nChina from Jan 20, 2020 to April 20, 2020. Using the multiple-step forecasting,\nthe estimated average errors of 6-step, 7-step, 8-step, 9-step and 10-step\nforecasting were 1.64%, 2.27%, 2.14%, 2.08%, 0.73%, respectively. We predicted\nthat the time points of the provinces/cities entering the plateau of the\nforecasted transmission dynamic curves varied, ranging from Jan 21 to April 19,\n2020.

One of the\nquestions many policy makers, and governments are asking themselves is how the\nspread is going to evolve in time. In this study, I applied an adapted SIR\nmodel previously used in South Korea to model the MERS outbreak, which is also\ncaused by a coronavirus, to estimate the evolution of the curve of active cases\nin the case of the Portuguese situation, using Italian dara. I then construct\nfive different scenarios for the evolution of covid-19 in Portugal. In the out\nof control scenario, the number of active cases could reach as much as ~40,000\npeople on the 5th of April (out-of-control scenario). If the self-protective\nand control are taken in the same level as what was considered for the South\nKorean model, this number could have be reduced to about 800 cases (scenario\n1). Considering that this scenario is now unrealistic, three other scenarios\nwere devised. In all these scenarios, the government measures had a 50\\%\neffectiveness when compared to the measures in Korea. But in scenario 2 the\ntransmission rate $\\beta$ was effectively reduced to 50\\%, In this scenario\nactive cases could reach circa 7,000 people. In scenario 3, the transmission\nrate $\\beta$ was reduced to 70\\% of its initial value, in which the number of\ncases would reach a peak of ~11,000 people. And finally in scenario 4, $\\beta$\nwas reduced to 80\\%. In this scenario, the peak would be reached at about\n~13,000 cases. This study shows the importance of control and self-protecting\nmeasure to bring down the number of affected people by following the\nrecommendations of the WHO and health authorities. With the appropriate\nmeasures, this number can be brought down to ~7,000-13,000 people.

Our\nanalysis reinforces well-established literature results, namely: \\emph{i}) that\nthe epidemic curves can be described by a Gaussian-type function; \\emph{ii})\nthat the temporal evolution of the accumulative number of infections and\nfatalities follow a logistic function, which has some resemblance with a\ndistorted Fermi-Dirac-like function; \\emph{iii}) the key role played by the\nquarantine to block the spread of Covid-19 in terms of an \\emph{interacting}\nparameter, which emulates the contact between infected and non-infected people.\nFurthermore, in the frame of elementary percolation theory, we show that:\n\\emph{i}) the percolation probability can be associated with the probability of\na person being infected with Covid-19; \\emph{ii}) the concepts of blocked and\nnon-blocked connections can be associated, respectively, with a person\nrespecting or not the social distancing, impacting thus in the probability of\nan infected person to infect other people. Increasing the number of infected\npeople leads to an increase in the number of net connections, giving rise thus\nto a higher probability of new infections (percolation). We demonstrate the\nimportance of social distancing in preventing the spread of Covid-19 in a\npedagogical way. Given the impossibility of making a precise forecast of the\ndisease spread, we highlight the importance of taking into account additional\nfactors, such as climate changes and urbanization, in the mathematical\ndescription of epidemics.

One solution involves splitting one ventilator\nto treat multiple patients and is in principle easy to implement, but there are\nobvious risks, and little is known on how the technique would work on patients\nwith ARDS from Covid-19. Previous studies have shown that multiple test lungs\nof equal characteristics can be successfully ventilated from one machine, but\nthat large variations in tidal volume delivery occurs when lungs with different\ncompliance are connected. In contribution to the discussion of the feasibility\nof the technique, a technical assessment was done including experiments\nexpanding on the previous studies using two types of test lungs, different\nventilator settings and test lung characteristics. Using two test lungs\nconnected to a ventilator, the tidal volumes and pressures into both lungs were\nmeasured for different combinations of lung compliance, airway resistances,\nmodes of ventilation, inspiratory and end-expiratory pressure levels. We found\ndiscrepancies in delivered tidal volumes for paired test lungs proportional\nwith compliance differences, little influence from differences in airway\nresistances, and that changes in compliance of only one test lung would also\nchange the tidal volume delivered to the other test lung when in volume\ncontrolled mode. For one of the test lung types, we also found that higher PEEP\nsettings could strongly influence the tidal volume balance between the test\nlungs. From this study and from a technical point of view, we were not able to\nidentify reliable settings, adjustments or any simple measures to overcome the\nhazards of this simple technique, and a more advanced solution is indicated for\nmitigating risks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Mar 2020 12:04:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 6 Jun 2020 11:45:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-09","authors_parsed":[["Martinsen","T.",""],["Tronstad","C.",""],["Olsen","M.",""],["Rosseland","L.

They are applied to study the\nspreading of infections, as in the case of CoviD-19, where the counting of the\ncumulated number $N(t)$ of detected infected individuals is a generally\naccepted, coarse-grain, variable to understand the epidemic phase. However\n$N(t)$ does not take into account the unknown number of asymptomatic, not\ndetected, cases $A(t)$. Therefore, the question arises if the observed time\nseries of data of $N(t)$ is a reliable tool for monitoring the evolution of the\ninfectious disease. We study a system of coupled differential equations which\nincludes the dynamics of the spreading among symptomatic and asymptomatic\nindividuals and the strong containment effects due to the social isolation. The\nsolution is therefore compared with a macroscopic law for the population $N(t)$\ncoming from a single, non-linear, differential equation with no explicit\nreference to $A(t)$, showing the equivalence of the two methods. Indeed, $N(t)$\ntakes into account a more complex and detailed population dynamics which\npermits the evaluation of the number of asymptomatic individuals also. The\nmodel is then applied to Covid-19 spreading in Italy where a transition from an\nexponential behavior to a Gompertz growth for $N(t)$ has been observed in more\nrecent data. Then the information contained in the data analysis of $N(t)$ is\nreliable to understand the epidemic phase, although it does not describe the\ntotal infected population. The asymptomatic population is larger than the\nsymptomatic one in the fast growth phase of the spreading.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Mar 2020 15:03:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 19 Apr 2020 09:53:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-21","authors_parsed":[["Lanteri","D.",""],["Carco'","D.",""],["Castorina","P.",""]]}

Individuals' social\nbehaviour and health status are assumed to be random, with probability\ndistributions that vary with their type. First a formulation and analysis is\ngiven for the basic SI (\"susceptible-infective\") network contagion model, which\nfocusses on the cumulative number of people that have been infected. The main\nresult is an analytical formula valid in the large $N$ limit for the state of\nthe system on day $t$ in terms of the initial conditions. The formula involves\nonly one-dimensional integration. Next, more realistic SIR and SEIR network\nmodels, including \"removed\" (R) and \"exposed\" (E) classes, are formulated.\nThese models also lead to analytical formulas that generalize the results for\nthe SI network model. The framework can be easily adapted for analysis of\ndifferent kinds of public health interventions, including vaccination, social\ndistancing and quarantine. The formulas can be implemented numerically by an\nalgorithm that efficiently incorporates the fast Fourier transform. Finally a\nnumber of open questions and avenues of investigation are suggested, such as\nthe framework's relation to ordinary differential equation SIR models and agent\nbased contagion models that are more commonly used in real world epidemic\nmodelling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Apr 2020 16:12:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 22 Sep 2020 16:48:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-23","authors_parsed":[["Hurd","T.

Due to the dynamic development of infections and the\ntime lag between when patients are infected and when a proportion of them\nenters an intensive care unit (ICU), the need for future intensive care can\neasily be underestimated. To infer future ICU load from reported infections, we\nsuggest a simple statistical model that (1) accounts for time lags and (2)\nallows for making predictions depending on different future growth of\ninfections. We have evaluated our model for three regions, namely Berlin\n(Germany), Lombardy (Italy), and Madrid (Spain). Before extensive containment\nmeasures made an impact, we first estimate the region-specific model\nparameters. Whereas for Berlin, an ICU rate of 6%, a time lag of 6 days, and an\naverage stay of 12 days in ICU provide the best fit of the data, for Lombardy\nand Madrid the ICU rate was higher (18% and 15%) and the time lag (0 and 3\ndays) and the average stay (4 and 8 days) in ICU shorter. The region-specific\nmodels are then used to predict future ICU load assuming either a continued\nexponential phase with varying growth rates (0-15%) or linear growth. Thus, the\nmodel can help to predict a potential exceedance of ICU capacity. Although our\npredictions are based on small data sets and disregard non-stationary dynamics,\nour model is simple, robust, and can be used in early phases of the disease\nwhen data are scarce.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Apr 2020 17:54:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 27 Jul 2020 14:50:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-28","authors_parsed":[["Ritter","Matthias",""],["Ott","Derek V.

We hereby present\nan analysis of the discourse around #Covid-19, based on a corpus of 200k tweets\nposted on Twitter during March and April 2020.

We then measure and compare the popularity of the WAR frame to\nthree alternative figurative frames (MONSTER, STORM and TSUNAMI) and a literal\nframe used as control (FAMILY). The results show that while the FAMILY literal\nframe covers a wider portion of the corpus, among the figurative framings WAR\nis the most frequently used, and thus arguably the most conventional one.\nHowever, we conclude, this frame is not apt to elaborate the discourse around\nmany aspects involved in the current situation. Therefore, we conclude, in line\nwith previous suggestions, a plethora of framing options, or a metaphor menu,\nmay facilitate the communication of various aspects involved in the\nCovid-19-related discourse on the social media, and thus support civilians in\nthe expression of their feelings, opinions and ideas during the current\npandemic.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Apr 2020 10:14:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 2 Oct 2020 10:26:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-05","authors_parsed":[["Wicke","Philipp",""],["Bolognesi","Marianna M.",""]]}

I show that these variations correlate strongly with the level of the\nviral receptor protein ACE2 in rat lungs, which is consistent with the still\nlimited and apparently contradictory data on human ACE2. Surprisingly, lower\nlevels of the receptor correlate with higher fatality. However, a previous\nmathematical model predicts that the speed of viral progression in the organism\nhas a maximum and then declines with the receptor level. Moreover, many\nmanifestations of severe CoViD-19, such as severe lung injury, exacerbated\ninflammatory response and thrombotic problems may derive from increased\nAngiotensin II (Ang-II) level that results from degradation of ACE2 by the\nvirus. I present here a mathematical model based on the influence of ACE2 on\nviral propagation and disease severity. The model fits Covid-19 fatality rate\nacross age and sex with high accuracy ($r^2>0.9$) under the hypothesis that\nSARS-CoV-2 infections are in the dynamical regimes in which increased receptor\nslows down viral propagation. Moreover, rescaling the model parameters by the\nratio of the binding rates of the spike proteins of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2\nallows predicting the fatality rate of SARS-CoV across age and sex, thus\nlinking the molecular and epidemiological levels. The presented model opposes\nthe fear that angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB), suggested as a therapy\nagainst the most adverse effects of CoViD-19, may favour viral propagation, and\nsuggests that Ang-II and ACE2 are candidate prognostic factors for detecting\npopulation that needs stronger protection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Apr 2020 17:34:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 30 Apr 2020 13:54:12 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 3 May 2020 16:47:13 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 29 Sep 2020 10:40:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-30","authors_parsed":[["Bastolla","Ugo",""]]}

To this aim, a\nmachine learning approach based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) is\nproposed to automatically identify the model parameters based on a training set\nof data of progressive increasing size, considering Lombardy in Italy as a case\nstudy. The analysis of the scatter in the forecasts shows that model\npredictions are quite sensitive to the size of the dataset used for training,\nand that further data are still required to achieve convergent -- and therefore\nreliable -- predictions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Apr 2020 08:42:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-20","authors_parsed":[["Paggi","Marco",""]]}

Our models may be used for\ndata interpretation and for guiding predictions regarding this disease, e.g.\nthe onset of the maximum in the number of new cases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 Apr 2020 12:24:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 10 Jun 2020 16:06:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-11","authors_parsed":[["Radiom","Milad",""],["Berret","Jean-Franccois",""]]}

As a consequence of its highly infectious nature,\ncountries all over the world have imposed extremely strict measures to control\nits spread. Since the earliest stages of this major pandemic, academics have\ndone a huge amount of research in order to understand the disease, develop\nmedication, vaccines and tests, and model its spread. Among these studies, a\ngreat deal of effort has been invested in the estimation of epidemic parameters\nin the early stage, for the countries affected by Covid-19, hence to predict\nthe course of the epidemic but the variability of the controls over the course\nof the epidemic complicated the modeling processes. In this article, the\ndetermination of the basic reproduction number, the mean duration of the\ninfectious period, the estimation of the timing of the peak of the epidemic\nwave is discussed using early phase data. Daily case reports and daily\nfatalities for ten countries over the period January 22, 2020 - April 18, 2020\nare evaluated using the Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) model. For each\ncountry, the SIR models fitting cumulative infective case data within 5% error\nare analysed. It is observed that the basic reproduction number and the mean\nduration of the infectious period can be estimated only in cases where the\nspread of the epidemic is over (for China and South Korea in the present case).\nNevertheless, it is shown that the timing of the maximum and timings of the\ninflection points of the proportion of infected individuals can be robustly\nestimated from the normalized data. The validation of the estimates by\ncomparing the predictions with actual data has shown that the predictions were\nrealised for all countries except USA, as long as lock-down measures were\nretained.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Apr 2020 21:08:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 10 Jul 2020 09:57:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-13","authors_parsed":[["Ahmetolan","Semra",""],["Bilge","Ayse Humeyra",""],["Demirci","Ali",""],["Peker-Dobie","Ayse",""],["Ergonul","Onder",""]]}

After lockdown, at first sight it seems that social distancing is not\nenough to control the outbreak. We discuss here a possible explanation, namely\nthat the lockdown is creating social heterogeneity: even if a large majority of\nthe population complies with the lockdown rules, a small fraction of the\npopulation still has to maintain a normal or high level of social interactions,\nsuch as health workers, providers of essential services, etc. This results in\nan apparent high level of epidemic propagation as measured through\nre-estimations of the basic reproduction ratio.

A common question is if and when\na country or region will reach herd immunity $h$. The classical herd immunity\nlevel $h_C$ is defined as $h_C=1-1/R_0$, where $R_0$ is the basic reproduction\nnumber, for covid-19 estimated to lie somewhere in the range 2.2-3.5 depending\non country and region. It is shown here that the disease-induced herd immunity\nlevel $h_D$, after an outbreak has taken place in a country/region with a set\nof preventive measures put in place, is actually substantially smaller than\n$h_C$. As an illustration we show that if $R_0=2.5$ in an age-structured\ncommunity with mixing rates fitted to social activity studies, and also\ncategorizing individuals into three categories: low active, average active and\nhigh active, and where preventive measures affect all mixing rates\nproportionally, then the disease-induced herd immunity level is $h_D=43\\%$\nrather than $h_C=1-1/2.5=60\\%$. Consequently, a lower fraction infected is\nrequired for herd immunity to appear. The underlying reason is that when\nimmunity is induced by disease spreading, the proportion infected in groups\nwith high contact rates is greater than that in groups with low contact rates.\nConsequently, disease-induced immunity is stronger than when immunity is\nuniformly distributed in the community as in the classical herd immunity level.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 May 2020 19:22:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-08","authors_parsed":[["Britton","Tom",""],["Ball","Frank",""],["Trapman","Pieter",""]]}

It has already caused thousands of\ncausalities and infected several millions worldwide. Any technological tool\nthat can be provided to healthcare practitioners to save time, effort, and\npossibly lives has crucial importance. The main tools practitioners currently\nuse to diagnose Covid-19 are Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain reaction\n(RT-PCR) and Computed Tomography (CT), which require significant time,\nresources and acknowledged experts.

In this study,\nwe propose a novel approach for Covid-19 recognition from chest X-ray images.\nDespite the importance of the problem, recent studies in this domain produced\nnot so satisfactory results due to the limited datasets available for training.\nRecall that Deep Learning techniques can generally provide state-of-the-art\nperformance in many classification tasks when trained properly over large\ndatasets, such data scarcity can be a crucial obstacle when using them for\nCovid-19 detection. Alternative approaches such as representation-based\nclassification (collaborative or sparse representation) might provide\nsatisfactory performance with limited size datasets, but they generally fall\nshort in performance or speed compared to Machine Learning methods. To address\nthis deficiency, Convolution Support Estimation Network (CSEN) has recently\nbeen proposed as a bridge between model-based and Deep Learning approaches by\nproviding a non-iterative real-time mapping from query sample to ideally sparse\nrepresentation coefficient' support, which is critical information for class\ndecision in representation based techniques.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 May 2020 13:11:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-11","authors_parsed":[["Yamac","Mehmet",""],["Ahishali","Mete",""],["Degerli","Aysen",""],["Kiranyaz","Serkan",""],["Chowdhury","Muhammad E.

In this work, we plug this gap through market based\nmechanisms designed to efficiently allocate capacity constrained public goods.\nTo design these mechanisms, we leverage the theory of Fisher markets, wherein\neach agent in the economy is endowed with an artificial currency budget that\nthey can spend to avail public goods. While Fisher markets provide a strong\nmethodological backbone to model resource allocation problems, their\napplicability is limited to settings involving two types of constraints -\nbudgets of individual buyers and capacities of goods. Thus, we introduce a\nmodified Fisher market, where each individual may have additional physical\nconstraints, characterize its solution properties and establish the existence\nof a market equilibrium. Furthermore, to account for additional constraints we\nintroduce a social convex optimization problem where we perturb the budgets of\nagents such that the KKT conditions of the perturbed social problem establishes\nequilibrium prices. Finally, to compute the budget perturbations we present a\nfixed point scheme and illustrate convergence guarantees through numerical\nexperiments. Thus, our mechanism, both theoretically and computationally,\novercomes a fundamental limitation of classical Fisher markets, which only\nconsider capacity and budget constraints.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 May 2020 16:34:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 24 May 2020 15:40:50 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 16 Jul 2020 00:25:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-17","authors_parsed":[["Jalota","Devansh",""],["Qi","Qi",""],["Pavone","Marco",""],["Ye","Yinyu",""]]}

We present here an analysis of an\nextended Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (SEIR) model that accounts for\nasymptomatic carriers, and explore the effect of different intervention\nstrategies such as social distancing (SD) and testing-quarantining (TQ). The\ntwo intervention strategies (SD and TQ) try to reduce the disease reproductive\nnumber $R_0$ to a target value $R_0^{\\rm target} < 1$, but in distinct ways,\nwhich we implement in our model equations. We find that for the same target\n$R_0^{\\rm target} <1$, TQ is more efficient in controlling the pandemic than\nlockdowns that only implement SD. However, for TQ to be effective, it has to be\nbased on contact tracing and the ratio of tests/day to the number of new\ncases/day has to be scaled with the mean number of contacts of an infectious\nperson, which would be high in densely populated regions with low levels of SD.\nWe point out that, apart from $R_0$, an important quantity is the largest\neigenvalue of the linearised dynamics which provides a more complete\nunderstanding of the disease progression, both pre- and post- intervention, and\nexplains observed data for many countries. Weak intervention strategies (that\nreduce $R_0$ but not to a value less than $1$) can reduce the peak values of\ninfections and the asymptotic affected population.

Experimental results of disease\nspreading shows that that at low visibility rates contact tracing slows disease\nspreading. However to stop disease spreading, contact tracing requires both\nsignificant visibility (at least 60%) into the proximity graph and the ability\nto place half of the population under isolation. We find that pro-actively\nisolating super-links -- key proximity encounters -- has significant benefits:\ntargeted isolation of a fourth of the population based on 35% visibility into\nthe proximity graph prevents an epidemic outbreak.

In\norder to support the possibility of some in-person learning, we study a\nmathematical model of the diffusion of the epidemic due to school opening, and\nevaluate plans aimed at containing the extra Covid-19 cases due to school\nactivities while ensuring an adequate number of in-class learning periods.

For instance, CT and MRI have\nadvantages over each other in terms of imaging quality, artifacts, and output\ncharacteristics that lead to differential diagnosis. The capacity of current\nsegmentation techniques is only allow to work for an individual domain due to\ntheir differences. However, the models that are capable of working on all\nmodalities are essentially needed for a complete solution. Furthermore,\nrobustness is drastically affected by the number of samples in the training\nstep, especially for deep learning models. Hence, there is a necessity that all\navailable data regardless of data domain should be used for reliable methods.\nFor this purpose, this manuscript aims to implement a novel model that can\nlearn robust representations from cross-domain data by encapsulating distinct\nand shared patterns from different modalities. Precisely, covariate shift\nproperty is retained with structural modification and adversarial loss where\nsparse and rich representations are obtained. Hence, a single parameter set is\nused to perform cross-domain segmentation task. The superiority of the proposed\nmethod is that no information related to modalities are provided in either\ntraining or inference phase. The tests on CT and MRI liver data acquired in\nroutine clinical workflows show that the proposed model outperforms all other\nbaseline with a large margin. Experiments are also conducted on Covid-19\ndataset that it consists of CT data where significant intra-class visual\ndifferences are observed.

This failure has been masked by a\nsort of delusion in which the people of this region are subjected to the\nhardship of searching for clean and healthy water in their own ponds, rivers,\nstreams and shallow hand-dug local wells on a continuous basis. Less than 17%\nof the rural population in all the SSAn communities can access basic\nhand-washing facilities and sanitation systems. The total water productivity,\nas measured by the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per cubic meter of total\nfreshwater withdrawn, for the people was less than 5 GDP.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Jun 2020 10:46:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-09","authors_parsed":[["Kayode","John Stephen",""],["Embrandiri","Asha",""],["Olateju","Adijat Olubukola",""]]}

Recent research found\nthat countries with universal Bacillus Calmette-Gu\\'erin (BCG) childhood\nvaccination policies tend to be less affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nHowever, such ecological studies are biased by numerous confounders. Instead,\nthis paper takes advantage of a rare nationwide natural experiment that took\nplace in Sweden in 1975, where discontinuation of newborns BCG vaccination led\nto a dramatic fall of the BCG coverage rate from 92% to 2% , thus allowing us\nto estimate the BCG's effect without all the biases associated with\ncross-country comparisons.

It considers: both detected and undetected infected populations,\nmedical quarantine and social sequestration, release from sequestration, plus\npossible reinfection. The coefficients in the model are evaluated by fitting to\nempirical data for eight US states: Arizona, California, Florida, Illinois,\nLouisiana, New Jersey, New York State, and Texas. Together these states make up\n43% of the US population; some of these states appear to have handled their\ninitial outbreaks well, while others appear to be emerging hotspots. The\nevolution of Covid-19 is fairly similar among the states: variations in contact\nand recovery rates remain below 5%; however, not surprisingly, variations are\nlarger in death rate, reinfection rate, stay-at-home effect, and release rate\nfrom sequestration. The results reveal that outbreaks may have been well\nunderway in several states before first detected and that California might have\nseen more than one influx of the pandemic. Our projections based on the current\nsituation indicate that Covid-19 will become endemic, spreading for more than\ntwo years. Should states fully relax stay-at-home orders, most states may\nexperience a secondary peak in 2021. If lockdowns had been kept in place, the\nnumber of Covid-19 deaths so far could have been significantly lower in most\nstates that opened up. Additionally, our model predicts that decreasing contact\nrate by 10%, or increasing testing by approximately 15%, or doubling lockdown\ncompliance (from the current $\\sim$ 15% to $\\sim$ 30%) will eradicate\ninfections in the state of Texas within a year.

While the adopted\nmitigation measures (including the lockdown) have generally proven useful,\npolicymakers are now facing a critical question: how and when to lift the\nmitigation measures? A carefully-planned exit strategy is indeed necessary to\nrecover from the pandemic without risking a new outbreak.

Epidemic is modelled as a discrete time stochastic\nprocess on random geometric networks. In the simulations we assume that the\nbasic reproduction number is $R_0=2.5$ and the infectious period lasts ca. ten\ndays. We also assume that the virus leads to severe acute respiratory syndrome\nin about one percent of cases, which in turn almost surely lead to respiratory\ndefault and death, unless the patient receives an appropriate medical treatment\nsupported by respiratory ventilation. For other parameters, like mortality rate\nor the number of respiratory ventilators per million of inhabitants, we take\nvalues typical for developed countries. We simulate populations of $10^5-10^6$\npeople. We compare different strategies: do-nothing, social distancing,\nreduction of social mixing and lockdown, assuming that there is no vaccine and\nno efficient medicine. The results of the simulations show that strategies that\nslow down the spread of epidemic too much are inefficient in reducing the\ncumulative excess of deaths. A hybrid strategy in which lockdown is in place\nfor some time and is then completely released is inefficient as well.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 28 Jun 2020 12:14:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-30","authors_parsed":[["Burda","Zdzislaw",""]]}

Our data are results from antibody tests in some\npopulation sample, where the test parameters, such as the true/false positive\nrates, are unknown. Our method scans the entire parameter space, and rejects\nparameter values using the joint data density as the test statistic. The\nproposed method is conservative for marginal inference, in general, but its key\nadvantage over more standard approaches is that it is valid in finite samples\neven when the underlying model is not point identified. Moreover, our method\nrequires only independence of serology test results, and does not rely on\nasymptotic arguments, normality assumptions, or other approximations. We use\nrecent Covid-19 serology studies in the US, and show that the parameter\nconfidence set is generally wide, and cannot support definite conclusions.\nSpecifically, recent serology studies from California suggest a prevalence\nanywhere in the range 0%-2% (at the time of study), and are therefore\ninconclusive. However, this range could be narrowed down to 0.7%-1.5% if the\nactual false positive rate of the antibody test was indeed near its empirical\nestimate (~0.5%). In another study from New York state, Covid-19 prevalence is\nconfidently estimated in the range 13%-17% in mid-April of 2020, which also\nsuggests significant geographic variation in Covid-19 exposure across the US.\nCombining all datasets yields a 5%-8% prevalence range. Our results overall\nsuggest that serology testing on a massive scale can give crucial information\nfor future policy design, even when such tests are imperfect and their\nparameters unknown.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Jun 2020 17:25:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-30","authors_parsed":[["Toulis","Panos",""]]}

Many ``structured models'' capture aspects of the contact\nstructure through an underlying network or a mixing matrix. An important\nobservation in such models, is that once a fraction $1-1/\\mathcal{R}_0$ has\nbeen infected, the residual susceptible population can no longer sustain an\nepidemic. A recent observation of some structured models is that this threshold\ncan be crossed with a smaller fraction of infected individuals, because the\ndisease acts like a targeted vaccine, preferentially immunizing higher-risk\nindividuals who play a greater role in transmission. Therefore, a limited\n``first wave'' may leave behind a residual population that cannot support a\nsecond wave once interventions are lifted. In this paper, we systematically\nanalyse a number of mean-field models for networks and other structured\npopulations to address issues relevant to the Covid-19 pandemic. In particular,\nwe consider herd-immunity under several scenarios. We confirm that, in networks\nwith high degree heterogeneity, the first wave confers herd-immunity with\nsignificantly fewer infections than equivalent models with lower degree\nheterogeneity. However, if modelling the intervention as a change in the\ncontact network, then this effect might become more subtle. Indeed, modifying\nthe structure can shield highly connected nodes from becoming infected during\nthe first wave and make the second wave more substantial. We confirm this\nfinding by using an age-structured compartmental model parameterised with real\ndata and comparing lockdown periods implemented either as a global scaling of\nthe mixing matrix or age-specific structural changes. We find that results\nregarding herd immunity levels are strongly dependent on the model, the\nduration of lockdown and how lockdown is implemented.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Jul 2020 11:26:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-15","authors_parsed":[["Di Lauro","Francesco",""],["Berthouze","Luc",""],["Dorey","Matthew D.",""],["Miller","Joel C.",""],["Kiss","Istv\u00e1n Z.",""]]}

As a result, it is widely recognized now that widespread testing\nis key to containing the spread of the disease and opening up the economy.\nHowever, the current testing regime has been unable to keep up with testing\ndemands. Hence, there is a need for an alternative approach for repeated\nlarge-scale testing of COVID-19. The emergence of wearable medical sensors\n(WMSs) and novel machine learning methods, such as deep neural networks (DNNs),\npoints to a promising approach to address this challenge.

In today's interconnected global\nsociety, such contagion processes can cause global public health hazards, as\nexemplified by the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. It is therefore of great\npractical relevance to investigate the network trans-mission of contagious\ndiseases from the perspective of statistical inference. An important and widely\nstudied boundary condition for contagion processes over networks is the\nso-called epidemic threshold. The epidemic threshold plays a key role in\ndetermining whether a pathogen introduced into a social contact network will\ncause an epidemic or die out. In this paper, we investigate epidemic thresholds\nfrom the perspective of statistical network inference. We identify two major\nchallenges that are caused by high computational and sampling complexity of the\nepidemic threshold. We develop two statistically accurate and computationally\nefficient approximation techniques to address these issues under the Chung-Lu\nmodeling framework. The second approximation, which is based on random walk\nsampling, further enjoys the advantage of requiring data on a vanishingly small\nfraction of nodes. We establish theoretical guarantees for both methods and\ndemonstrate their empirical superiority.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Jul 2020 14:54:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-30","authors_parsed":[["Dasgupta","Anirban",""],["Sengupta","Srijan",""]]}

We describe the impact on the\nreproduction number $\\mathcal{R}_c$ of Covid-19. In particular, we discuss the\nimportance and relevance of parameters of the model such as the number of\nreported cases, effectiveness of tracking and monitoring policy, and the\ntransmission rates to contact tracing. We describe the terms ``perfect\ntracking'', ``perfect monitoring'' and ``perfect reporting'' to indicate that\ntraced contacts will be tracked while incubating, tracked contacts are\nefficiently monitored so that they do not cause secondary infections, and all\ninfected persons are reported, respectively. We consider three special\nscenarios: (1) perfect monitoring and perfect tracking of contacts of a\nreported case, (2) perfect reporting of cases and perfect monitoring of tracked\nreported cases and (3) perfect reporting and perfect tracking of contacts of\nreported cases. Furthermore, we gave a lower bound on the proportion of\ncontacts to be traced to ensure that the effective reproduction,\n$\\mathcal{R}_c$, is below one and describe $\\mathcal{R}_c$ in terms of\nobservable quantities such as the proportion of reported and traced cases.\nModel simulations using the Covid-19 data obtained from John Hopkins University\nfor some selected states in the US suggest that even late intervention of CT\nmay reasonably reduce the transmission of Covid-19 and reduce peak\nhospitalizations and deaths. In particular, our findings suggest that effective\nmonitoring policy of tracked cases and tracking of traced contacts while\nincubating are more crucial than tracing more contacts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Aug 2020 02:06:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-11","authors_parsed":[["Biala","T.

Miles et al.\n(2020) argue that the March-June UK lockdown was more costly than the benefit\nof lives saved, evaluated using the NICE threshold of {\\pounds}30000 for a\nquality-adjusted life year (QALY) and that the costs of a lockdown for 13 weeks\nfrom mid-June would be vastly greater than any plausible estimate of the\nbenefits, even if easing produced a second infection wave causing over 7000\ndeaths weekly by mid-September.\n  I note here two key problems that significantly affect their estimates and\ncast doubt on their conclusions. Firstly, their calculations arbitrarily cut\noff after 13 weeks, without costing the epidemic end state. That is, they\nassume indifference between mid-September states of 13 or 7500 weekly deaths\nand corresponding infection rates. This seems indefensible unless one assumes\nthat (a) there is little chance of any effective vaccine or improved medical or\nsocial interventions for the foreseeable future, (b) notwithstanding temporary\nlockdowns, COVID-19 will very likely propagate until herd immunity. Even under\nthese assumptions it is very questionable. Secondly, they ignore the costs of\nserious illness, possible long-term lowering of life quality and expectancy for\nsurvivors. These are uncertain, but plausibly at least as large as the costs in\ndeaths.\n  In summary, policy on tackling COVID-19 cannot be rationally made without\nestimating probabilities of future medical interventions and long-term illness\ncosts. More work on modelling these uncertainties is urgently needed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Jul 2020 12:51:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 12 Aug 2020 16:23:16 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 24 Aug 2020 19:32:51 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 26 Aug 2020 13:58:31 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Sat, 19 Sep 2020 14:50:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-01","authors_parsed":[["Kent","Adrian","","Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical\n  Physics, University of Cambridge"]]}

We propose a novel approach,\ncalled DRR4Covid, to learn automated COVID-19 diagnosis and infection\nsegmentation on CXRs from digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRRs). DRR4Covid\ncomprises of an infection-aware DRR generator, a classification and/or\nsegmentation network, and a domain adaptation module. The infection-aware DRR\ngenerator is able to produce DRRs with adjustable strength of radiological\nsigns of COVID-19 infection, and generate pixel-level infection annotations\nthat match the DRRs precisely. The domain adaptation module is introduced to\nreduce the domain discrepancy between DRRs and CXRs by training networks on\nunlabeled real CXRs and labeled DRRs together.We provide a simple but effective\nimplementation of DRR4Covid by using a domain adaptation module based on\nMaximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD), and a FCN-based network with a classification\nheader and a segmentation header.

Now more than ever, it has become paramount to\npush the limits of online learning in every manner to keep flourishing the\neducation system. One crucial component of online learning is Knowledge Tracing\n(KT). The aim of KT is to model student's knowledge level based on their\nanswers to a sequence of exercises referred as interactions. Students acquire\ntheir skills while solving exercises and each such interaction has a distinct\nimpact on student ability to solve a future exercise. This \\textit{impact} is\ncharacterized by 1) the relation between exercises involved in the interactions\nand 2) student forget behavior. Traditional studies on knowledge tracing do not\nexplicitly model both the components jointly to estimate the impact of these\ninteractions. In this paper, we propose a novel Relation-aware self-attention\nmodel for Knowledge Tracing (RKT). We introduce a relation-aware self-attention\nlayer that incorporates the contextual information. This contextual information\nintegrates both the exercise relation information through their textual content\nas well as student performance data and the forget behavior information through\nmodeling an exponentially decaying kernel function. Extensive experiments on\nthree real-world datasets, among which two new collections are released to the\npublic, show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art knowledge tracing\nmethods.

We assume that the positivity of asymptomatic people not being contact\ncases (ANBC) is representative of the positivity of the whole French\npopulation, which allows estimating the real incidence. We estimate, using\nSant\\'e Public France reports, that the incidence at the beginning of August\nwas about 0.8% and rose to about 2.4% of the total population at the beginning\nof September. This corresponds to about 1.6 million people simultaneously\ninfected and 230.000 new infections each day. These evaluations allow to deduce\nthat intensive care units (ICU) admission rate and infection fatality rate\n(IFR) dropped by one order of magnitude since March, and are currently 0.036%\nand 0.027% respectively. Basic simulations of the outbreak evolution based on\nthe hypothesis of negligible reinfection probability are performed for France,\nIle de France, Puy de Dome, Bouches du Rhone and Grand Est. These simulations\nare using a reproduction rate (R) constant over time ranging from 1.3 to 1.45\n(1.15 in Grand Est). They use an estimation of the number of infection which\noccurred during the first wave. These simulations also use the estimated\nincidence, which by reducing the susceptible population weeks after weeks\ninduces a saturation of the otherwise exponential growth of the outbreak. An\nincidence peak of 3.5 % is expected at week 39 for France. The calculated total\nnumber of ICU admission and deaths during the second wave are 9000 and 7000\nrespectively for R=1.3. The cumulative incidence over the two waves is computed\nclose to 60% for R=1.3 and 70% for R=1.4. This suggests that if individual\nimmunity exists, herd immunity is likely to be achieved in France by the end of\nOctober 2020.

An expression for the rough-fuzzy\nestimate of changepoints is derived along with its mathematical properties\nconcerning fast computation. In a statistical hypothesis testing framework,\nasymptotic distribution of the proposed statistic on both single and multiple\nchangepoints is derived under null hypothesis enabling multiple changepoint\ndetection. Extensive simulation studies have been performed to investigate how\nsimple crude statistical measures of disparity can be subjected to improve\ntheir efficiency in estimation of gradual changepoints. Also, the said\nrough-fuzzy estimate is robust to signal-to-noise ratio, high degree of\nfuzziness in true changepoints and also to hyper parameter values. Simulation\nstudies reveal that the proposed method beats other fuzzy methods and also\npopular crisp methods like WBS, PELT and BOCD in detecting gradual\nchangepoints.

In\nthis work, the spread of COVID-19 under local quarantine measures is modeled\nusing the Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered model on complex networks. In\nthis network approach, the links connected to isolated people are disconnected\nand then reinstated when they are released. This link dynamics leads to\ntime-dependent reproduction number. Numerical simulations are performed on\nnetworks with reaction rates estimated from empirical data. The temporal\npattern of the cumulative number of confirmed cases is then reproduced. The\nresults show that a large number of asymptomatic infected patients are detected\nas they are quarantined together with infected patients. Additionally, possible\nconsequences of the breakdowns of local quarantine measures and social\ndistancing are considered.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Oct 2020 15:16:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-15","authors_parsed":[["Choi","K.",""],["Choi","Hoyun",""],["Kahng","B.",""]]}

These are based on the number of excess deaths attributed\neither directly or indirectly to the epidemic. Unfortunately the data on which\nsuch comparisons rely are often incomplete and unreliable. This article\ndiscusses problems of interpretation of data even when the data is largely\naccurate and delayed by at most two to three weeks. This applies to the Office\nof National Statistics in the UK, the Statistisches Bundesamt in Germany and\nthe Belgian statistical office Statbel. The data in the article is taken from\nthese three sources. The number of excess deaths is defined as the number of\ndeaths minus the baseline, the definition of which varies from country to\ncountry. In the UK it is the average number of deaths over the last five years,\nin Germany it is over the last four years and in Belgium over the last 11\nyears. This means that in all cases the individual baselines depend strongly on\nthe timing and intensity of adverse factors such as past influenza epidemics\nand heat waves. This makes cross-country comparisons difficult. A baseline\ndefined as the number the number of deaths in the absence of adverse factors\ncan be operationalized by taking say the 10\\% quantile of the number of deaths.\nThis varies little over time and European countries within given age groups. It\ntherefore enables more robust and accurate comparisons of different countries.\nThe article criticizes the use of Z-scores which distort the comparison between\ncountries. Finally the problem of describing past epidemics by their timing,\nthat is start and finish and time of the maximum, and by their effect, the\nheight of the maximum and the total number of deaths, is considered.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Oct 2020 14:40:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-21","authors_parsed":[["Davies","Laurie",""]]}

The proposed principal components model allows for same-quality\nrepresentation of the clustering of regions. In fact, the clusters become more\ndistinctive and the apparent outliers become either more pronounced with the\ncomponent model clustering or are alleviated with the respective hierarchical\ncluster. Thus, a five-component model was obtained and validated upon 85\nregions of Russian Federation and 19 socio-economic parameters. The principal\ncomponents allowed to describe approximately 75 percent of the initial\nparameters variation and enable further simulations upon the studied variables.\nThe cluster analysis upon the principal components modelling enabled better\nexposure of regional structure and disparity in economic development in Russian\nFederation, consisting of four main clusters: the few-numbered highest\ndevelopment regions, the clusters with mid-to-high and low economic\ndevelopment, and the \"poorest\" regions. It is observable that the development\nin most regions relies upon resource economy, and the industrial potential as\nwell as inter-regional infrastructural potential are not realized to their\nfullest, while only the wealthiest regions show highly developed economy, while\nthe industry in other regions shows signs of stagnation which is scaled further\ndue to the conditions entailed by economic sanctions and the recent Covid-19\npandemic.
